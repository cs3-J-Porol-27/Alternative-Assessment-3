            <h3> Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000)</h3>
            <p>The story revolves around Harry Potter, a young wizard embarking on his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It delves into the enigma surrounding how
            Harry's name becomes an unexpected participant in the Triwizard Tournament, compelling him to take part in the competition. </p>
	    <p> Experience: The very first Harry Potter book I have read out of all the books in the Harry Potter franchise (I don't recommend not reading the books in order).
            This book holds a special place in my heart as this is the novel that sparked my passion for reading. I could still remember the euphoric feeling of reading this book for the first time. </p>

		    <h3> When I Fly Towards You (2023) </h3>
			<p> During the early days of autumn in 2012, Su Zai Zai, a lively transfer student, arrives at Yucai Middle School. On her very first day, she meets Zhang Lu Rang, who exudes
			a distant and composed demeanor, and immediately finds herself smitten with him. </p>
			<p> Experience: This series beautifully represents the essence of youth, and the beauty of friendships, while also capturing the journey into adolescence. Watching this show, can certainly
			give viewers a feeling of "kilig" and excitement watching the two main couples and their silly interactions. </p>
